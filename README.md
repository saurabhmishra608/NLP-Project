Note: In the model's folder, we have only included weights of yolo tiny-prn model. To use other variants of yolo, refer to [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRx24ILSQI0qpHkqyHfU98XJLOw1UJEL?usp=share_link) link for the pretrained weights.

## Output video
We made a demo video with American Sign Language spelling out "PLAY U" where "U" is the name of the song. The output video of the same is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AB_w0enuulD8nX1QD_PyTMzr3l23zFiX/view?usp=share_link).
